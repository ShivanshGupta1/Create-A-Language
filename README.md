# Create-A-Language
This is my create a lang's part 2 -> FULLY INTEGRATED WITH A CRUD SYSTEM. 

This is created using -
  
  1. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  2. [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
  3. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  4. [Ejs](https://ejs.co/) 
  5. [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
  6. [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
  
The backend is entirely on **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** 

To *use* it, you can create you language with your name and email! Then you can simply click on *"use my lang"*! 
Just enter your **email** and now you can translate from your **language to english** and from **english to YOUR language**! Have fun creating different codes from and to your friends!
